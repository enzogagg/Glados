# Introduction to CLaD Standard Library

Welcome, test subject.

The CLaD (Generic Language and Data Operand Syntax) standard library gathers all essential tools provided with the language to facilitate your testing in the Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.

It is organized into several categories to optimize your workflow and ensure quality science.

---

## Basic Types

CLaD includes **fundamental types** calibrated for maximum precision:

- **Numbers** (Integers and Floats): To calculate portal trajectories.
- **Strings**: To communicate with turrets (or insult the AI).
- **Lists**: To organize your test results.
- **Booleans** (#t and #f): Truth is binary. The cake is a lie.

These types are integrated into the core system. CLaD defines their *syntax*, *behavior*, and *operations*.

## Native Functions & Built-ins

For your safety (and that of science), CLaD provides:

- A set of highly optimized **native functions** (builtins),
- Integrated **exceptions** to handle unexpected errors (like neurotoxin).

These are accessible **immediately**, without administrative forms.

---

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is structured for quick learning:

1. **Native Functions**: The building blocks.
2. **Basic Types**: The construction materials.
3. **Thematic Modules**: Advanced tools for advanced testing.

---

## Navigation

You can:

- Follow the **sequential** protocol for complete training.
- Access necessary data **directly** via the index.
- Explore freely (at your own risk).

**Good luck with your tests in CLaD.**
