# Introduction to the **CLaD** Standard Library

Welcome, test subject.

The CLaD (Generic Language and Data Operand Syntax) standard library brings together all the essential tools provided with the language to facilitate your testing within the Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.

It is organized into several categories to optimize your workflow and guarantee quality science.

---

## Basic Types

CLaD includes **fundamental types** calibrated for maximum precision:

- **Numbers** (Integers and Floats): For calculating portal trajectories.
- **Strings**: For communicating with turrets (or insulting the AI).
- **Lists**: To organize your test results.
- **Booleans** (#t and #f): Truth is binary. The cake is a lie.

These types are built into the core of the system. CLaD defines their *syntax*, their *behavior*, and their *operations*.

## Native Functions & Built-in Exceptions

For your safety (and for science), CLaD provides:

- a set of highly optimized **native functions** (builtins),
- **built-in exceptions** to handle unexpected errors (like neurotoxin).

They are available **immediately**, without administrative paperwork.

---

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is structured for rapid learning:

1. **Native functions**: The building blocks.
2. **Basic types**: The construction materials.
3. **Thematic modules**: Advanced tools for advanced testing.

---

## Navigation

You can:

- Follow the **sequential** protocol for complete training.
- Access necessary data **directly** via the index.
- Explore freely (at your own risk).
