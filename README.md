# GLaDOS (Generic Language and Data Operand Syntax)

> "The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment."

A minimalist LISP interpreter written in Haskell, developed for the Epitech **GLaDOS** project (Part 1 & 2). This repository features a strict CI/CD pipeline, automated documentation with Docusaurus, and enforced commit standards.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

* **Haskell Stack**: For building and testing the project.
* **Make**: For standard compilation rules.
* **Node.js & npm**: Required for Commitlint (git hooks) and Docusaurus.

## Installation

When cloning this repository for the first time, you **MUST** run the setup steps to configure your local environment and git hooks.

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js dependencies (for commit linting & docs)
npm install

# 2. Install Git Hooks (Pre-commit & Commit-msg)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# 3. Build the project to ensure everything is working
make
```

## Documentation

The project documentation is automatically generated and hosted on GitHub Pages. It includes:
- **User Manual**: How to use the GLaDOS interpreter.
- **Developer API**: Technical documentation generated by Haddock.

**[Read the Documentation](https://enzogagg.github.io/Glados/)**

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to ensure code quality and stability. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1.  **Linting**: Checks code style and formatting (Haskell & Commit messages).
2.  **Build & Test**: Compiles the project and runs the test suite.
3.  **Mirroring**: Pushes the code to the Epitech repository (only on push to main).
4.  **Documentation**: Builds and deploys the Docusaurus site and Haddock API docs (only on push to main).
